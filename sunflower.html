Ecologically, sunflowers are copious nectar producers, providing food for pollinating bees, 
while the seeds and leaves provide food for such animals as birds, insects, and squirrels. 
For humans, all parts of the plant are used. The seeds of the common sunflower are eaten and 
are a source of a valuable oil (one of the most important vegetable oils). The leaves and stalks 
are used as fodder for livestock, and the flowers yield a yellow die.
